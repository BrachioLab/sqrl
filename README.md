# The Statistical Quantile Rule Learning (SQRL) Framework

This is the implementation of the SQRL framework as proposed in our ICML '23 paper ["Do Machine Learning Models Learn Statistical Rules Inferred from Data?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01433).
For each of the following tasks, we provide a separate folder containing the code and instructions to reproduce the results reported in the paper:
* [Object Detection](object_detection/README.md)
* [Semantic Analysis](semantic_analysis/README.md)
* [Time Series Data Imputation](time_series_imputation/README.md)
* [Image Classification](image_classification/README.md)
* [Tabular Data Classification](tabular_classification/README.md)
