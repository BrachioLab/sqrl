# The Statistical Quantile Rule Learning (SQRL) Framework

This is the implementation of the SQRL framework as proposed in our paper "Do Machine Learning Models Learn Statistical Rules Inferred from Data?".
For each of the following tasks, we provide a separate folder containing the code and instructions to reproduce the results reported in the paper:
* [Object Detection](object_detection/README.md)
* [Semantic Analysis](semantic_analysis/README.md)
* [Time Series Data Imputation](time_series_data_imputation/README.md)
* [Image Classification](image_classification/README.md)
* [Tabular Data Classification](tabular_classification/README.md)
